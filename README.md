# Tasty Recipes - Recipe Sharing Platform

## Project Overview
Tasty Recipes is a simple recipe-sharing platform developed using PHP, Bootstrap, and JSON flat files. The project allows users to create, view, edit, and delete recipes. Each recipe can include a title, ingredients, instructions, cooking time, and category, along with an optional image.
